This program shows how to use the new Kinect with OpenCV in C++.
Copyright (C) Steven Hickson 2014. See License.txt

This is preliminary software and/or hardware and APIs are preliminary and subject to change.

This uses CMake to find  OpenCV to compile appropriately so it requires all the dependencies of OpenCV.

The OpenCV_Kinect2SDK.cpp file is an example of how to use the grabber.

We will be converting the method to event based in the next version.
